// Particles — the shared one-shot PARTICLE BURST atom for the family
// (perch's confetti/fireworks, wand's gesture burst). The celebratory
// "pop": a field of dots that fly out, arc under gravity, spin, and fade.
//
// This is the SAME pattern Effects already ships for the border flash
// (`FlashState` / `rollFlash` / `resolveBorder`), scaled from a handful of
// blink colors to a field of moving particles:
//
//   1. ROLL once at the trigger — `rollBurst` picks each particle's initial
//      conditions (position, velocity, color, spin, …) and stamps `now`.
//      The result is a `Sendable` value the app stores in one cell, exactly
//      like a `FlashState?`.
//   2. RESOLVE per frame — `resolveParticles(burst, now:)` returns the live
//      particles in CLOSED FORM (`x = x₀ + v·t`, `y = y₀ + v·t + ½g·t²`,
//      `alpha = 1 − t/(duration·life)`). NO Euler integration, NO mutable sim
//      state, NO per-frame `dt`: re-sampling the same `now` always yields the same
//      frame (replayable, unit-testable), and a dropped frame can't drift
//      the trajectory. (perch's driver integrated `dt` each tick — correct,
//      but frame-rate-dependent and stateful; the closed form is exact.)
//   3. DRAW per frame — the app paints the resolved particles. A ready-made
//      AppKit `drawParticles` helper (behind `#if canImport(AppKit)`, the
//      `drawLinePets` precedent) renders glowing sparks + tumbling paper, or
//      the app draws its own from the pure `ResolvedParticle` list.
//
// PHILOSOPHY — identical to the rest of Effects/Motion: the pure tier is
// `Sendable`, AppKit-free, `UInt32`/`Double` only; the app owns the redraw
// clock, the `NSColor` materialization, and the "off" gate. `EffectIntensity`
// (the shared subtle…wild knob, from `Palette`) scales the count + reach.
//
// COORDINATES — the sim's +y points DOWN (gravity is positive-y), the
// screen-natural sense, matching perch's flipped overlay canvas. Host the
// draw in an `isFlipped` (top-left-origin) view so gravity falls on-screen;
// in a y-up context, negate `gravity` at roll time.
